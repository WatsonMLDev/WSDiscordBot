## Persistent Databases
When you pull new versions, more than likely your database will be over-written. Make sure to implement some type of database saving plan. 

One method is to fork this repository, add this repo as an upstream dependency to your fork, then implement some type of cloud saving.

Another is to use a syncing application (like Syncthing) to restore the DB on updates.
